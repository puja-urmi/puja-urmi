## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Puja Saha, a M.A.Sc. student in Computer Engineering (CGPA: 3.93/4.00) at the University of Guelph, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering (CGPA: 3.68/4.00). My research interests encompass model architecture adaptation, decentralized machine learning, optimization, and multimodal AI for healthcare applications.

I am currently conducting research on privacy-preserving medical image analysis, with a focus on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of models in decentralized setup. My work involves developing innovative methodologies that effectively handle data disparities, addressing critical challenges in medical AI while ensuring data privacy and security.

I am actively seeking research opportunities in these domains, aiming to contribute to advancements in machine learning methodologies for diverse applications..
