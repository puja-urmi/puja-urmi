## Hi there! 👋  

I am **Puja Saha**, a **M.A.Sc. student in Computer Engineering** (CGPA: 3.93/4.00) at the **University of Guelph**, with a **Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering** (CGPA: 3.68/4.00). My research interests lie in **model architecture adaptation**, **decentralized machine learning**, **optimization**, and **multimodal AI** for healthcare applications.  

Currently, I am researching **privacy-preserving medical image analysis** in decentralized setups. My work focuses on developing robust and generalizable methodologies to address data disparities, ensuring both high performance and strict data privacy in medical AI applications.  

I am actively seeking **internship opportunities** where I can apply my expertise to real-world challenges and contribute to advancing machine learning methodologies for impactful applications.
